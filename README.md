# Description

This repository contains a collection of codespaces which can be used to demonstrate the
[feature](https://github.com/features/codespaces) at various levels, from a default codespace (i.e.,
with no configuration specified) to a complex one with full support for developing machine learning
applications using Python.

Each of the following branches can be used to showcase a different type of codespace:

- [default](https://github.com/octo-faq/codespaces-demo-python/tree/default): No codespace
  configuration. This can be used to illustrate what a barebones codespace looks like and how it can
  be used to bootstrap more complex codespaces or to simply create and modify files using a more
  powerful tool than the default GitHub editor.
- [simple](https://github.com/octo-faq/codespaces-demo-python/tree/simple): Basic, manually-crafted
  codespace which can be used to develop a simple Python application.
- [complex](https://github.com/octo-faq/codespaces-demo-python/tree/complex):
  Complex codespace containing a large collection of libraries, modules and tools which together
  form an environment where a machine learning application can be developed with little to no
  initial setup effort needed.

# Usage instructions

Start with the [default](https://github.com/octo-faq/codespaces-demo-python/tree/default) branch,
then proceed to [simple](https://github.com/octo-faq/codespaces-demo-python/tree/simple), then
finally [complex](https://github.com/octo-faq/codespaces-demo-python/tree/complex). Each branch
will contain a `README.md` with further instructions.
